    <!-- For more detailed information on different configurations that an agent can support and the respective rules,
    consult the online documentation. In general, configuration properties may be set in different ways. Here is the
    order of precedence of how the agent will read and respect specific configurations.
      1. Environment Variables
      2. System Properties
      3. Default/Root controller-info.xml. See .../$(Agent-Base-Install-Dir)/conf/controller-info.xml -->

    <!-- This is the host name or the IP address of the AppDynamics Controller (e.g., 192.168.1.22 or myhost or
    myhost.abc.com). This is the same host that you use to access the AppDynamics browser-based User interface. This can
    be overridden with the environment variable 'CONTROLLER_HOST_NAME' or the system property
    '-Dappdynamics.controller.hostName' -->
    <controller-host>amer-ps-sandbox.saas.appdynamics.com</controller-host>

    <!-- This is the http(s) port of the AppDynamics Controller. If 'controller-ssl-enabled' (below) is set to true, you
    must specify the HTTPS port of the Controller; otherwise, specify the HTTP port. The default values are 8090 for
    HTTP and 8181 for HTTPS. This is the same port that you use to access the AppDynamics browser-based User interface.
    This can be overridden with the environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_CONTROLLER_PORT' or the system property
    '-Dappdynamics.controller.port' -->
    <controller-port>443</controller-port>

    <!-- This specifies if the AppDynamics agent should use SSL (HTTPS) to connect to the Controller. If you set this to
    true, the controller port property above should be set to the HTTPS port of the Controller. This can be overridden
    with the environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_CONTROLLER_SSL_ENABLED' or the system property
    '-Dappdynamics.controller.ssl.enabled' -->
    <controller-ssl-enabled>true</controller-ssl-enabled>

    <!-- Set this flag to 'true' to enable features required for AppDynamics Orchestration, including the following:
    1) Enables the agent to execute tasks specified in AppDynamics Orchestration workflows.
    2) Enables the agent to resolve the AppDynamics Controller host and port when the host machine where this agent
       resides is created through AppDynamics Orchestration. -->
    <enable-orchestration>false</enable-orchestration>

    <!-- The Machine Agent uses the Java API to get the host name of the agent. The results from the API can be
    inconsistent, and the same JVM can sometimes return a different value for the same machine each time the machine
    agent is restarted. It is recommended to set this field in the following scenarios:

    1) The machine host name is not constant
    2) You prefer to use a specific name in the UI
    3) The machine has both a machine agent and app agents on it.

    This can be overridden with the environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_UNIQUE_HOST_ID' or the system property
    '-Dappdynamics.agent.uniqueHostId' -->
    <unique-host-id>BrendanDonnelly_KafkaHost</unique-host-id>

    <!-- This key is generated at installation time and can be found by viewing the license information in the
    controller settings. This can be overridden with the environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_KEY' or
    the system property '-Dappdynamics.agent.accountAccessKey' -->
    <account-access-key>ii7d3di3aco5</account-access-key>

    <!-- If the AppDynamics Controller is running in multi-tenant mode or you are using the AppDynamics SaaS Controller,
    you must specify the account name for this agent to authenticate with the controller. If you are running in
    single-tenant mode (the default) there is no need to configure this value. This can be overridden with the
    environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_AGENT_ACCOUNT_NAME' or the system property '-Dappdynamics.agent.accountName' -->
    <account-name>amer-ps-sandbox</account-name>

    <!-- If this agent is licensed for Server Monitoring, set this flag to 'true' to enable Server Monitoring expanded
    metrics. This can be overridden with the environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_SIM_ENABLED' or the system property
    '-Dappdynamics.sim.enabled' -->
    <sim-enabled>true</sim-enabled>

    <!-- This value is used to create the hierarchy infrastructure view in the UI for this machine. Each hierarchy level
    should be separated with a vertical bar ("|"). For example, if this machine belongs to "DataRack1" and it is located
    in "Virginia Data Center", then the machine path could be set to "Virginia Data Center|DataRack1|Machine1" and the
    UI will display it in that hierarchy ("Virginia Data Center|DataRack1"). The last element of the path indicates the
    server name (e.g., "Machine1") and appears as the name on the servers list in the UI. This can be overridden with
    the environment variable 'APPDYNAMICS_MACHINE_HIERARCHY_PATH' or the system property
    '-Dappdynamics.machine.agent.hierarchyPath'.

    Note: The number of characters up to but not including the last vertical bar must not exceed 95. -->
